I’m a detail-oriented **software engineer** based in Arnhem, The Netherlands. I specialize in PHP/**Laravel**
development, with a profound passion for delivering **quality**. I thrive on collaborative learning and enjoy creating a
**positive work atmosphere** through humor and support. In my spare time I write projects using Kotlin and TypeScript,
play video games and play the bass guitar.

[This website](https://github.com/pindab0ter/hansvl.nl) was made by me using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and a modified
and polished version of [Chringel’s theme](https://github.com/chringel21/chringel-hugo-theme).
