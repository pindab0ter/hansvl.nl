Iâ€™m a detail-oriented **software engineer** based in Arnhem, The Netherlands. I specialize in
PHP/**Laravel** development, with a profound passion for delivering **quality**, both for the
product as for the code. I thrive on collaborative learning and enjoy creating a **positive work
atmosphere** through humor and support. In my spare time I write projects using Kotlin and
TypeScript, play video games and play the bass guitar.

This website was made by me using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pindab0ter/hansvl.nl), and uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
