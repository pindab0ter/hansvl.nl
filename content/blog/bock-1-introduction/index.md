Egg, Inc. ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/egg-inc/id993492744),
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.auxbrain.egginc)) is an idle game by the lovely people
at [Auxbrain](https://auxbrain.com/). It offers time-limited contracts that can be completed by joining a co-op with
other players. This lead to me being invited to a private Discord community in October 2015.

The community would organize co-op teams using spreadsheets, detailing team captains, multiple scenarios for different
max co-op sizes, Discord channels that would have to be co-ordinated, the works. I asked them to _please_ tell me this 
wasnâ€™t all manual labour. It was.

I offered to automate the process, and they accepted. 

This blog series is about how I created a Discord bot to help.
